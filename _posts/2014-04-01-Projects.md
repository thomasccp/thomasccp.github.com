Open-source projects always inspire me. 
Everyone is contributing to the community and is influencing the world. 
With the open-source movement, ideas, knowledge and skills are shared, 
projects are reviewed and improved, and the world is made to a better place! 

I am still a newbie, but why can't I start contributing? Let's do and learn...

This is [my GitHub account] (https://github.com/thomasccp). 
Not many stuffs there yet, some source codes of my research projects, 
my silly attempt on the [project-euler](http://projecteuler.net/) challenge, and my working thesis (:D).

I have also created an organisation, [custom-computing-ic](https://github.com/custom-computing-ic), 
to put some projects related to the custom computing research group where I am doing my PhD.

Speaking of projects, GitHub has an awesome feature to generate a web site for projects, 
check [here](https://pages.github.com/). 
I have made one for my [SMCGen project](http://cc.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/smcgen)!

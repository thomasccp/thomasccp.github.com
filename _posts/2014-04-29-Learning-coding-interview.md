There are plenty of online resources to help us learn and revise coding, especially when we are preparing for an interview.
Here is a list of websites that I found interesting:

1. [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net)

	The website contains hundreds of computational problems focusing on mathematics (prime numbers, squared numbers, triangle numbers, etc). 
	One new problem is added every weekend.
	You can start from some very basic problems or try to solve challenging ones.
	There is a system with levels and awards to motivate yourself and keep track of your progress.
	You can also add your friends to make it more competitive :)

2. [Talentbuddy] (http://www.talentbuddy.co/)

	The programming problems are classified into several main categories: languages, interviews, databases, projects and fun.
	You can go through them to familiar yourself with algorithms, data structures, and popular interview questions.
	The website comes with online compilers for various programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc) so you can just do everything with your browser.
	Similar to many SNS, you can add friends and challenge them.

3. [UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/)

	The website has over 4000 problems.
	You can submit a solution in C, C++, Pascal and Java.
	There is a ranking about the number of problem solved.
	Apart from correctness, the system also takes run time into account, so you are more motivated to provide a run-time optimised solution.

4. [topcoder](http://www.topcoder.com/)

5. [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com/)

6. [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)

7. [IPSC](http://ipsc.ksp.sk/)

8. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)

	From Wikipedia: "The website features thousands of educational resources, including a personalized learning dashboard, over 100,000 exercise problems, and over 5,000 micro lectures[5] via video tutorials stored on YouTube teaching mathematics, history, healthcare, medicine, finance, physics, general chemistry, biology, astronomy, economics, cosmology, organic chemistry, American civics, art history, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and computer science."

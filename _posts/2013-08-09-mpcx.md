The new Maxeler MPC-X2000 up and running. It has 6 MAX4 FPGA cards which are connected to the CPU host via Infiniband.

To use it, connect to `maia01`:

Requirements of the new system:

* MaxCompiler 2013.2.2 or later is needed.
* In Run Rules of DFE, select `Enable MPC-X`.
* Set the environment variable `SLIC_CONF = "default_engine_resource=192.168.0.10"`.

Some notes about the new system:

* FPGA clock speed: MAX4 can be clocked at a higher frequency. For a medium-size design (50% logic usage), it is not difficult to achieve 200 MHz. On MAX3, 150 MHz is already quite a challenge.
* DRAM clock speed: 400-533 MHz, higher than MAX3 which is 300-400 MHz.
* Floating-point precision: MAX4 supports single-precison, double-precision, and single-extended precision. 
Single-extended precision means: 
> 1. 11 bits exponent which must be less than the width of the mantissa field, 
> 2. The width of the mantissa field must be a minimum of 31 bits, 
> 3. The sum of the widths of the sign bit, exponent field, and mantissa field must be a minimum of 43 bits and a maximum of 64 bits. 
In general, the flexibility is less than that of MAX3 because it allows precisions lower than single.
* Hardware build time of MAX4 is roughly the same as MAX3. On MAX4, Coregen is not necessary, so it could be a little bit faster.
